<p>I'm a second-year PhD researcher in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Irvine. Since September 2020, I am a visiting researcher at the <a href=https://www.ici.nccu.edu.tw/">International College for Innovation</a>, National Chengchi University in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>

<p>My current research examines the digital data and infrastructure that communities need to effectively address entangled economic, environmental and public health challenges. I partiuclarly focus on environmental governance in petrochemical communities, including work on the <a href=https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/formosa-plastics-archive/essay">Formosa Plastics Archive</a>.</p>

<p>I am further developing this focus on "civic data" across a series of collaborative research, infrastructure and pedagogy <a href="https://flamboyant-wozniak-b5d794.netlify.app/projects">projects</a>, considering civic data in different settings and across systems and scales.</p>

<p>As a member of the design group for the Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (<a href="https://worldpece.org/">PECE</a>), I am interested in questions of data sharing culture, research project architecture and community outreach. I currently edit a monthly PECE-newsletter, you can sign up <a href="https://github.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=28f50ca38ef652df957d5cbd6&amp;id=0ed4893b1f">here</a>.</p>
