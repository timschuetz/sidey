<p>I'm a second-year PhD researcher in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Irvine.</p>

<p>My current research examines the digital data and infrastructure that communities need to effectively address entangled economic, environmental and public health challenges. 

I am developing my focus on "civic data" across a series of collaborative research, infrastructure and pedagogy <a href="https://flamboyant-wozniak-b5d794.netlify.app/projects">projects</a>.  From September to October 2020, I am a visiting researcher at the International College for Innovation, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan. Together with a team of collaborators, I am doing field work and building the [Formosa Plastics Archive](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/formosa-plastics-archive/essay).  </p>

<p>As a member of the design group for the Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (<a href="https://worldpece.org/">PECE</a>), I am interested in using the software for infrastructuring my PhD research, including project architecture and community outreach. You can sign up for a monthly PECE-newsletter <a href="https://github.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=28f50ca38ef652df957d5cbd6&amp;id=0ed4893b1f">here</a>).</p>

<p>If you are an educator or organizer, you may also be interested in open access teaching material for the undergraduate course <a href="https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/environmental-injustice-summer-2020/essay">Environmental Injustice</a>.</p>
