I'm a PhD researcher at Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Irvine. You can reach me via tschuetz@uci.edu and @tmschtz.My research about civic data capacity examines the digital data and infrastructure that communities need to effectively address entangled economic, environmental and public health challenges. See my most recent publications.

I'm also a Design Group Member for the Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (PECE) and edit a monthly PECE newsletter (sign up here).

I further co-develop a series of collaborative research, infrastructure and pedagogy projects. You may be interested in open access teaching material for the course Beyond Environmental Injustice, including the Instagram research community run by students and me.
