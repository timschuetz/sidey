I am a second-year graduate student in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Irvine. I studied Communication, Media and Cultural Anthropology (BA, 2017) at the University of Bremen and Bahcesehir University in Istanbul. I also hold a prospective MA (2020) in Science and Technology Studies from Goethe University Frankfurt. My research has been funded by the German Fulbright Commission and the German Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung).
