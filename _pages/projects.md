I currently participate in and co-develop a series of collaborative research, teaching and infrastructure projects:

### [Quotidian Anthropocenes](http://disaster-sts-network.org/content/quotidian-anthropocene/essay)
explores how "the Anthropocene" is playing out on the ground in different settings.  The aim is to create both situated, place-based and comparative perspective, building new modes of collective knowledge and action.

### [Transnational STS COVID-19 Project](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/transnational-sts-covid-19-project/essay)
brings together researchers in the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) to follow and analyze COVID-19 as it plays out in different settings. 

### [Visualizing Toxic Places](http://centerforethnography.org/content/cfp-visualizing-toxic-places/essay)
a collaborative experiment with new ethnographic methods and modes of expression. The project is designed to explore "toxicity" in many guises (chemical, discursive, gendered, mediated, and others), "place" (as an analytic focus in ethnography, in experience, as site of governance, and so on), and ways "toxic places" can be conveyed and analyzed through diverse modes of visualization.

### [STS-Migtec](http://sts-migtec.org/news-events/sts-migtec-circle/)
an independent network of scholars at the intersection of science and technology studies (STS) and critical migration, security and border studies.
